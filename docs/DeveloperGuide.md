### Adding of Cheat-Sheet

The AddCheatSheetCommand class enables the creation, addition and saving of a .txt file to the current module‚Äôs ‚ÄúCheatsheet‚Äù directory (see Figure 6). Upon creating a new AddCheatSheetCommand object and calling the ‚Äúexecute‚Äù method on it, the GULIO Text Editor application will also be automatically started.

An invocation of the `add cheat-sheet` command involves the following interactions:

    Figure 10 - AddCheatSheetCommand Invocation Sequence Diagram
</p>

When the AddCheatSheet command is executed, it gets the current selected module by calling the ‚ÄúgetSelectedModule‚Äù method in ModuleList. It then calls the ‚ÄúgetDirectoryPath‚Äù method to obtain the directory where the cheat-sheet would be saved in. Then, it calls the ‚ÄúopenTextEditor‚Äù method in itself.

### Loading & Storing of Data

This section covers how the storage component works, from the loading of all module codes to the loading of individual module and creation of data files.

#### Saving of Data

The Writer class is responsible for writing any changes to the module‚Äôs data file, as well as creating the file itself. Interaction with this writer class is done through the ModuleList class, whose methods are called by the other components of the app.

    <img width="973" src="developerGuideImages/writeModule.png" alt="writeModule() Sequence Diagram"><br>
    Figure 11 - writeModule() Sequence Diagram
</p>

Whenever some data in a module changes, the command that made those changes would call the method ‚ÄúwriteModule‚Äù in ModuleList to update the change in the data file. This method would then call a method of the same name in the Writer class, which overwrites the existing data in the file with the new data.

Due to how much data needs to be written each time, we decided to split the data file by module. That way, we only need to overwrite the module's data when changes are made.

#### Loading of Data

The Loader class is responsible for identifying all the modules currently added, as well as loading the data file of the selected class. Like the Writer class, methods in the Loader class are accessed by the other components via the ModuleList class.

<p align="center">
    <img width="973" src="developerGuideImages/loadModuleCode.png" alt="loadModuleCodes() Sequence Diagram"><br>
    Figure 12 - loadModuleCodes() Sequence Diagram
</p>

To identify modules in the ‚ÄúData‚Äù directory, Duke would call ‚ÄúloadModuleCodes‚Äù method in the ModuleList. This method would then call the ‚ÄúgetModules‚Äù method in Loader, which returns a list of module codes. For each of the identified module code, ModuleList would call its own ‚ÄúinsertModule‚Äù method to add it to the module list.

<p align="center">
    <img width="973" src="developerGuideImages/setSelectedModule.png" alt="setSelectedModule() Sequence Diagram"><br>
    Figure 13 - setSelectedModule() Sequence Diagram
</p>

When a module is selected via the ‚ÄúsetSelectedModule‚Äù method, the specified module code would be searched for in the module list. If it is inside, ‚ÄúloadModule‚Äù method in the Loader would be called. This method reads the module‚Äôs data file for data and adds them into a new instance of Module class. This Module is then returned to ModuleList and set as the selected module.

If the Loader failed to load the file, null would be returned. If null is not returned, ModuleList would sort the data and then use Writer to override the existing file. This is done to remove invalid entries that were initially in the file.
