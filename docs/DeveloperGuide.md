# GULIO Developer Guide

**GULIO (Get Ur Life In Order)** is a desktop app that provides a single consolidated and personalised workspace for NUS SOC students to organize their modules. It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) which SOC students will be familiar with typing in, instead of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

This guide is for developers looking to modify GULIO. For users of GULIO, please refer to the User Guide [here](UserGuide.md).

## Introduction

### Background of GULIO

GULIO is a command line application for NUS SOC students to organize their modules. It has a 2-layer system: dashboard layer and module layer. In both layers, the user has access to a different set of commands.

On start up, the user will be on the dashboard layer and has an overview of all their modules. They will have access to module management commands such as adding, deleting or opening a particular module. Opening a module then puts them on the module layer where they can interact with the data within the module.

<p align="center">
    <img width="973" src="userGuideImages/2-layer.jpg" alt="2-Layer System"><br>
    Figure 1 - Visualisation of GULIO‚Äôs 2-layer system
</p>

Currently, GULIO is a basic university module manager intended to provide students with an overview and consolidated workspace for all of their modules, lessons, tasks and cheat-sheets. Going forward, we feel that GULIO has the potential for many more features to be added, some of which are proposed in the ‚ÄúImplementation‚Äù section.

### Purpose

This document describes the architecture and implementation details of the command line application, GULIO.

### Scope

This describes the software architecture and software design decisions for the implementation of GULIO. The intended audience of this document is the developers, designers, and software testers of GULIO.

&nbsp;

----

## Design

### Architecture

<p align="center">
    <img width="973" src="developerGuideImages/architecture.png" alt="Architecture Diagram"><br>
    Figure 2 - GULIO Architecture Diagram
</p>

`Duke` contains the main method which is required by Java to run the application. It is responsible for instantiating and calling methods from the `UI`, `Parser` and `Command` components.

Apart from `Duke`, the application consists of the following components:

* `UI`: Handles reading and printing
* `Parser`: Validates and checks user input
* `Command`: Executes commands
* `Model`: Consists of data related to the application
* `Storage`: Handles loading and storing of data into text files
* `Editor`: Graphical interface for users to type
* `Common`: collection of classes used by multiple components.


GULIO is a local application that stores its application data using readable text files, allowing users the flexibility of viewing and editing data locally.

The way GULIO runs and handles user input can be described as follows:

<p align="center">
    <img width="973" src="developerGuideImages/main-loop-sequence-diagram.png" alt="Sequence Diagram"><br>
    Figure 3 - GULIO Sequence Diagram
</p>

Upon start, the main class calls run() which enters a while loop and reads in user input. In the loop, the Parser component processes the user input into various commands implemented in GULIO. The loop ends when the user enters exit.

&nbsp;

### UI component

**API**: `UI.java`

* Facilitates the CLI interface
* Methods to display general messages, prompt messages and error messages
* Reads in user‚Äôs input, and used by Command classes to react to user‚Äôs inputs
* The UI object created as an attribute in Duke is passed into each command to be executed
* Instances of UI are used by tests in general

&nbsp;

### Parser component

**API**: `Parser.java`

* Determines the command entered by the user

* Parses the parameters needed by the `Command` object (for commands which require additional details)

* Checks the validity of parsed parameters, in some instances calling methods from other relevant classes, e.g. calling a method from the `Lessons` class to verify parsed lesson links.

* May instruct `UI` to print warnings and prompts to users, e.g. when users enter invalid parameters.

* Returns a new `Command` object with all the necessary attributes filled

&nbsp;

### Command component

<p align="center">
    <img width="973" src="developerGuideImages/command-component-level.png" alt="Dual Layer Command System"><br>
    Figure 4 - Visualisation of Dual Layer Command System
</p>

**API**: `Command.java`

The `Command` component is an abstract class with methods that all commands inherit from. They can be further distinguished by commands that are used when the user is at the dashboard or when the user is within a module specified.

Steps for command execution:

1. The `Parser` after validating user input returns a `Command` object
1. Each `Command` object has an execute method and gets executed by `Duke`
1. Depending on the command, it may make changes to the objects within `Model`
1. If there are changes, `Model` then updates application data via the `Storage` component
1. The `UI` prints user information related to the command executed


&nbsp;

### Model component

<p align="center">
    <img width="973" src="developerGuideImages/designModel.png" alt="Class Diagram of Model"><br>
    Figure 5 - Class Diagram of Model
</p>

The Model component consists of classes that represent real-world objects related to the program. `ModuleList` represents the various modules that a typical SOC student may be taking within the semester. Each of these modules is encapsulated in the `Module` class which contains an ArrayList of `Lesson` and `Task` objects representing the lessons that would be conducted for the module and tasks that students have to complete for the modules they are taking.

#### ModuleList:

`ModuleList` is responsible for managing loaded modules in the program and keeping track if a user is at the dashboard or within a selected module. `ModuleList` interacts with the `Loader` and `Writer` components to load and write data respectively to the storage files. It also contains methods to sort data that after loading and before writing.

The `ModuleList` class contains the attributes:

* ArrayList of module code strings
* Class-level member storing `Module`

#### Module:

The `Module` class contains the attributes:

* Module code string
* ArrayList of `Lesson`
* ArrayList of `Task`

#### Lesson:

In SOC, lessons are conducted by a combination of lectures, tutorials or labs. To enforce this constraint, the Enum class `LessonType` contains a set of constants for lecture, tutorial and lab.

The `Lesson` class contains attributes related to a typical course lesson:

* Lesson Type, e.g. lab, tutorial or lecture
* Time and day of the lesson (stored as a String for flexibility)
* Link for online lessons
* Teaching Staff information encapsulated in `TeachingStaff`

#### Teaching staff:

Being enrolled in several modules, it would be useful for students to store names of the teaching staff the way they prefer to be addressed along with their email addresses in events that require the student to call upon or inquire a teaching staff for a module.

The `TeachingStaff` class contains the attributes related to the teacher(s) of a particular lesson:

* Name of the teacher
* Email address of the teacher

#### Task:

The Task class contains attributes related to an assignment, deadline or task in a university setting

* Description of task
* Deadline of task
* Remarks
* Done status
* Graded status

&nbsp;

### Storage component

<p align="center">
    <img width="973" src="developerGuideImages/storage.png" alt="Storage Structure"><br>
    Figure 6 - Illustration of Storage Structure
</p>

The storage component is responsible for creating and loading modules and their respective data, as well as saving the data each time a change is made. It consists of two components: Loader and Writer. At every moment, the loader only loads up to 1 module at a time and data for each module is stored separately. This is done to ensure fast loading and writing of files.

#### Loader:

* Loads the list of modules from the ‚ÄúData‚Äù directory
* Loads lesson and task data from the selected module‚Äôs ‚Äú.txt‚Äù file

#### Writer:

* Creates all the directories required
* Deletes files and directories
* Creates the ‚Äú.txt‚Äù file that saves the module‚Äôs lessons and tasks
* Writes changes to the ‚Äú.txt‚Äù file that saves the module‚Äôs lessons and tasks

&nbsp;

### Editor component

**API**: `TextEditor.java`

The editor component is responsible for opening the text editor to add or edit cheat-sheets/notes. It consists of two components:

#### Text Editor

* Sets up the editor
* Loads existing file from Cheatsheet directory within a module for the edit cheat-sheet command
* Flushes out the text from the editor when a different or new file is opened.
* Adjusts the font size of the text within the editor
* Detects mouse input to change font style and save the text
* Saves the text from the text editor into a file

#### ShortcutListener

* Detects keyboard input for shortcuts

&nbsp;

### Common classes

Classes that are used by multiple components:
* CommonMethods: Stores methods that are used by multiple components
* Constants: Stores constants
* Messages: Stores strings that are printed by the UI
* DashboardCommands: Enum of commands that can be used outside a module
* ModuleCommands: Enum of commands that can be used inside a module

&nbsp;

----

## Implementation

In this section, we highlight a few of the key features whose implementations are reflective of most of the commands available, as well as those that are more unique to GULIO.

### Add Lesson

The AddLessonCommand class is responsible for the creation and addition of a new Lesson object to the lesson list of a given module. The following sequence diagrams shows how a new Lesson is created and added to the lesson list.

<p align="center">
    <img width="973" src="developerGuideImages/addLesson1.png" alt="parse() Sequence Diagram"><br>
    Figure 7 - parse() Sequence Diagram
</p>

The creation process is facilitated by the Parser class, which parses the appropriate arguments from the user input and initialises the Lesson object attributes with the parsed values.

<p align="center">
    <img width="973" src="developerGuideImages/addLessonCommand.png" alt="AddLessonCommand Constructor Sequence Diagram"><br>
    Figure 8 - AddLessonCommand Constructor Sequence Diagram
</p>

The newly created Lesson object is then passed to a new AddLessonCommand object as an argument.

<p align="center">
    <img width="973" src="developerGuideImages/add_lesson_to_lesson_list.png" alt="execute() AddLessonCommand Sequence Diagram"><br>
    Figure 9 - execute() AddLessonCommand Sequence Diagram
</p>

AddLessonCommand then adds the Lesson object to the lesson list of a module. The lessons in the list are sorted by their lesson types each time a new lesson is added. AddLessonCommand also calls the writeLesson method of ModuleList to update the change locally.

&nbsp;

### Adding of Cheat-Sheet

The AddCheatSheetCommand class enables the creation, addition and saving of a .txt file to the current module‚Äôs ‚ÄúCheatsheet‚Äù directory (see Figure 6). Upon creating a new AddCheatSheetCommand object and calling the ‚Äúexecute‚Äù method on it, the GULIO Text Editor application will also be automatically started.

An invocation of the `add cheat-sheet` command involves the following interactions:

<p align="center">
    <img width="973" src="developerGuideImages/file.png" alt="AddCheatSheetCommand Invocation Sequence Diagram"><br>
    Figure 10 - AddCheatSheetCommand Invocation Sequence Diagram
</p>

When the AddCheatSheet command is executed, it gets the current selected module by calling the ‚ÄúgetSelectedModule‚Äù method in ModuleList. It then calls the ‚ÄúgetDirectoryPath‚Äù method to obtain the directory where the cheat-sheet would be saved in. Then, it calls the ‚ÄúopenTextEditor‚Äù method in itself.

&nbsp;

### Loading & Storing of Data

This section covers how the storage component works, from the loading of all module codes to the loading of individual module and creation of data files.

#### Saving of Data

The Writer class is responsible for writing any changes to the module‚Äôs data file, as well as creating the file itself. Interaction with this writer class is done through the ModuleList class, whose methods are called by the other components of the app.

<p align="center">
    <img width="973" src="developerGuideImages/writeModule.png" alt="writeModule() Sequence Diagram"><br>
    Figure 11 - writeModule() Sequence Diagram
</p>

Whenever some data in a module changes, the command that made those changes would call the method ‚ÄúwriteModule‚Äù in ModuleList to update the change in the data file. This method would then call a method of the same name in the Writer class, which overwrites the existing data in the file with the new data.

Due to how much data needs to be written each time, we decided to split the data file by module. That way, we only need to overwrite the module's data when changes are made.

#### Loading of Data

The Loader class is responsible for identifying all the modules currently added, as well as loading the data file of the selected class. Like the Writer class, methods in the Loader class are accessed by the other components via the ModuleList class.

<p align="center">
    <img width="973" src="developerGuideImages/loadModuleCode.png" alt="loadModuleCodes() Sequence Diagram"><br>
    Figure 12 - loadModuleCodes() Sequence Diagram
</p>

To identify modules in the ‚ÄúData‚Äù directory, Duke would call ‚ÄúloadModuleCodes‚Äù method in the ModuleList. This method would then call the ‚ÄúgetModules‚Äù method in Loader, which returns a list of module codes. For each of the identified module code, ModuleList would call its own ‚ÄúinsertModule‚Äù method to add it to the module list.

<p align="center">
    <img width="973" src="developerGuideImages/setSelectedModule.png" alt="setSelectedModule() Sequence Diagram"><br>
    Figure 13 - setSelectedModule() Sequence Diagram
</p>

When a module is selected via the ‚ÄúsetSelectedModule‚Äù method, the specified module code would be searched for in the module list. If it is inside, ‚ÄúloadModule‚Äù method in the Loader would be called. This method reads the module‚Äôs data file for data and adds them into a new instance of Module class. This Module is then returned to ModuleList and set as the selected module.

If the Loader failed to load the file, null would be returned. If null is not returned, ModuleList would sort the data and then use Writer to override the existing file. This is done to remove invalid entries that were initially in the file.

&nbsp;

## Appendix: Instruction for Manual Testing

Due to the 2-layer command system, you will need to identify which layer you are on in order to run the tests correctly.To identify which layer you are on, simply check the tag beside your input, known as the **input label**.

* ‚ÄúGULIO‚Äù indicates that you are at the dashboard layer.
* A module code (e.g. ‚ÄúCS2113T‚Äù) indicates that you are within that module.
