# GULIO Developer Guide

**GULIO (Get Ur Life In Order)** is a desktop app that provides a single consolidated and personalised workspace for NUS SOC students to organize their modules. It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) which SOC students will be familiar with typing in, instead of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

This guide is for developers looking to modify GULIO. For users of GULIO, please refer to the User Guide [here](UserGuide.md).

## Introduction

### Background of GULIO

GULIO is a command line application for NUS SOC students to organize their modules. It has a 2-layer system: dashboard layer and module layer. In both layers, the user has access to a different set of commands.

On start up, the user will be on the dashboard layer and has an overview of all their modules. They will have access to module management commands such as adding, deleting or opening a particular module. Opening a module then puts them on the module layer where they can interact with the data within the module.

</p>

Currently, GULIO is a basic university module manager intended to provide students with an overview and consolidated workspace for all of their modules, lessons, tasks and cheat-sheets. Going forward, we feel that GULIO has the potential for many more features to be added, some of which are proposed in the ‚ÄúImplementation‚Äù section.

### Purpose

This document describes the architecture and implementation details of the command line application, GULIO.

### Scope

This describes the software architecture and software design decisions for the implementation of GULIO. The intended audience of this document is the developers, designers, and software testers of GULIO.
