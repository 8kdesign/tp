## Text Editor

GULIO comes with a built-in text-editor that allows you to edit cheat sheets directly. This text editor can be accessed via the add and edit cheat sheet commands. Cheat-sheets are stored in the ‚ÄúCheatsheet‚Äù directory within their respective module directories as ‚Äú.txt‚Äù files.

In the text editor, you can type in your notes in the text field. When done, remember to save any changes via the ‚Äúctrl-s‚Äù shortcut. To close the text editor, simply press the escape key on your keyboard. Using ‚Äúctrl-up‚Äù and ‚Äúctrl-down‚Äù, you can enlarge or shrink text respectively.

| Shortcuts | Actions |
| --- | --- |
| ctrl-s | Save cheat-sheet. | 
| ctrl-up | Enlarge text. |
| ctrl-down | Shrink text. |
| esc | Exit test editor |

> ‚ö† Do not include file extension (e.g. .‚Äù.txt‚Äù) when creating or editing the cheat-sheet.
