# User guide

**GULIO (Get Ur Life In Order)**  is a desktop app that provides a single consolidated and personalised workspace for NUS SOC students to organize their modules. GULIO is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) which SOC students will be familiar with typing in, instead of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

If you are having difficulties managing your schedule, lesson links and notes, GULIO is the app for you. With the ability to store lesson details, tasks, notes and more, GULIO is a one-stop solution for all your university scheduling needs.

This guide is written for users like you, for reference when there is a particular feature that you are unsure of how to use. It provides all the necessary information required for you to fully utilize GULIO's capabilities.

# Features

## Overview

GULIO has a 2-layer system, consisting of the dashboard layer and the module layer. In both layers, you have access to a different set of commands. 

<p align="center">
    <img width="973" src="userGuideImages/2-layer.jpg" alt="2-Layer System"><br>
    Figure 2 - Visualisation of GULIO‚Äôs 2-layer system
</p>

On start up, you will be on the dashboard layer where you have an overview of all your modules. You have access to module management commands like adding, deleting or opening a particular module.

Opening a module will put you on the module layer where you can interact with the data within the module.

> üí° Please refer to the section [Dashboard Commands](#dashboard-commands) for information regarding commands at the dashboard layer.<br>

> üí° Please refer to the section [Module Commands](#module-commands) for information regarding commands at the module layer.

To identify which layer you are on, simply check the tag beside your input.

* ‚ÄúGULIO‚Äù indicates that you are at the dashboard layer.
* A module code (e.g. ‚ÄúCS2113T‚Äù) indicates that you are within that module.

Each module can store two types of data: lesson and task. Lessons refer to your lectures, labs and tutorials, which are all recurring events. Meanwhile, tasks are used to store one-time events, like your homework, quizzes and any other activities with a deadline.

<!--@@author isaharon-->

### Fields in a lesson:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Lesson type | Lecture, lab or tutorial. |
| Day & time | Information on when the lesson happens. |
| Link | Online meeting link for lesson. |
| Teaching staff name | Name of the lesson's teacher. |
| Teaching staff email | Email of the lesson's teacher. |

### Fields in a task:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Task name | A short title for the task. |
| Deadline | Deadline of task in DD-MM-YYYY format. |
| Remarks | Additional information on the task. |
| Graded status | True or false, whether the task is graded. |
| Done status | True or false, whether the task is done. |

Additionally, you can store your lecture notes in GULIO using the cheat-sheet feature. Cheat-sheets are stored as text files and GULIO has a built-in text editor that can be used to edit them. Cheat-sheets are unformatted so that users can focus on writing the content.<br>

# Data & Storage

### Automatic Saving

Data for each module is stored in their respective module‚Äôs text file, located in a folder called ‚ÄúData‚Äù created in the same directory as the GULIO.jar file. When moving this folder, please ensure that it is placed in the same directory as your GULIO.jar file. After every modification, changes are automatically saved to the file. 

### Manual Editing Outside of GULIO

Files can be modified outside of the program. Invalid inputs will not be loaded when the program is run and will be removed from the file. To ensure that your data loads properly, please follow the format stated in the data files strictly.

#### Format for Lessons:

1. `lesson | <type> | <Day & Time>`
1. `lesson | <type> | <Day & Time> | <Link>`
1. `lesson | <type> | <Day & Time> | <Link> | <Teaching Staff Name>`
1. `lesson | <type> | <Day & Time> | <Link> | <Teaching Staff Name> | <Teaching Staff Email>`

> ‚ö† Only accepts 3 lesson types: ‚Äúlecture‚Äù, ‚Äúlab‚Äù and ‚Äútutorial‚Äù.

#### Format for Tasks:

1. `task | <description> | <deadline> | <is done> | <is graded>`
1. `task | <description> | <deadline> | <is done> | <is graded> | <remarks>`

> ‚ö† For `<is done>` and `<is graded>`, use ‚ÄòT‚Äô for true and ‚ÄòF‚Äô for false.

# Text Editor

GULIO comes with a built-in text-editor that allows you to edit cheat sheets directly. This text editor can be accessed via the add and edit cheat sheet commands. Cheat-sheets are stored in the ‚ÄúCheatsheet‚Äù directory within their respective module directories as ‚Äú.txt‚Äù files.

In the text editor, you can type in your notes in the text field. When done, remember to save any changes via the ‚Äúctrl-s‚Äù shortcut. To close the text editor, simply press the escape key on your keyboard. Using ‚Äúctrl-up‚Äù and ‚Äúctrl-down‚Äù, you can enlarge or shrink text respectively.

| Shortcuts | Actions |
| --- | --- |
| ctrl-s | Save cheat-sheet. | 
| ctrl-up | Enlarge text. |
| ctrl-down | Shrink text. |
| esc | Exit test editor |

> ‚ö† Do not include file extension (e.g. .‚Äù.txt‚Äù) when creating or editing the cheat-sheet.
