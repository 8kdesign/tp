# GULIO User guide

**GULIO (Get Ur Life In Order)**  is a desktop app that provides a single consolidated and personalised workspace for NUS SOC students to organize their modules. GULIO is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) which SOC students will be familiar with typing in, instead of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

If you are having difficulties managing your schedule, lesson links and notes, GULIO is the app for you. With the ability to store lesson details, tasks, notes and more, GULIO is a one-stop solution for all your university scheduling needs.

> üí° Verify this by running the command ‚Äújava --version‚Äù in command prompt (for Windows users) or Terminal (for Mac and Linux users).

### Steps:

1. Move the GULIO.jar file to your preferred directory.
1. Open command prompt (for Windows users) or Terminal (for Mac and Linux users),
1. Navigate to the directory of your GULIO.jar file.
1. Run the command ‚Äújava -jar gulio.jar‚Äù to start GULIO.

## Features

### Overview

GULIO has a 2-layer system, consisting of the dashboard layer and the module layer. In both layers, you have access to a different set of commands. On start up, you will be on the dashboard layer where you have an overview of all your modules. You have access to module management commands like adding, deleting or opening a particular module.

Opening a module will put you on the module layer, where you can interact with the data within the module.

> üí° Please refer to the section [Dashboard Commands](#dashboard-commands) for information regarding commands at the dashboard layer.<br>

> üí° Please refer to the section [Module Commands](#module-commands) for information regarding commands at the module layer.

To identify which layer you are on, simply check the tag beside your input.

* ‚ÄúGULIO‚Äù indicates that you are at the dashboard layer.
* A module code (e.g. ‚ÄúCS2113T‚Äù) indicates that you are within that module.

Each module can store two types of data: lesson and task. Lessons refer to your lectures, labs and tutorials, which are all recurring events. Meanwhile, tasks are used to store one-time events, like your homework, quizzes and any other activities with a deadline.

#### Fields in a lesson:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Lesson type | Lecture, lab or tutorial. |
| Day & time | Information on when the lesson happens. |
| Link | Online meeting link for lesson. |
| Teaching staff name | Name of the lesson's teacher. |
| Teaching staff email | Email of the lesson's teacher. |

#### Fields in a task:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Task name | A short title for the task. |
| Deadline | Deadline of task in DD-MM-YYYY format. |
| Remarks | Additional information on the task. |
| Graded status | True or false, whether the task is graded. |
| Done status | True or false, whether the task is done. |

Additionally, you can store your lecture notes in GULIO using the cheat-sheet feature. Cheat-sheets are stored as text files and GULIO has a built-in text editor that can be used to edit them. Cheat-sheets are unformatted so that users can focus on writing the content.<br>


> üí° Commands will be presented in the following format:

>> ### Command function : *keyword*

>> **Format:**<br>
>> `command format`
>>
>> **Example:** (if any)<br>
>> _table of interaction_
